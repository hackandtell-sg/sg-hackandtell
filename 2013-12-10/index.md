Hack and Tell, 2013-12-10
=========================

<img src=cam.jpg alt="Images from the sPICAM">

From empty editor buffers came:

  - [A simple image uploader](http://up.dabase.com/) authored by [Kai
    Hendry](https://github.com/kaihendry), so his parents can share
    photographs with less fuss.

  - [An Ansible module to deploy SSH configuration
    files](https://github.com/gaqzi/ansible-ssh-config), hand crafted by
    [Björn Andersson](https://github.com/gaqzi). 

  - [A toolchain to build a Kindle eBook of the Feynman
    Lectures](https://github.com/fmap/flp.mobi), thanks to [Patrick
    Haller](https://github.com/patrickhaller), [James
    Rivett-Carnac](https://github.com/yarbelk), [Gwen
    Tan](https://github.com/gwendolynregina), and (to the smallest
    extent) [I](https://github.com/fmap).

  - [Life](https://github.com/cheeaun/life), a tool to visualise
    a timeline of life events, by [Lim Chee
    Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun). It may be enough to say over
    eighteen hundred people have forked his life so far.

  - [kopi.js](https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js); a parser for
    descriptions of Singapore coffee, in *Coffee*script, with
    accompanying unit tests. So far this seems to have received major
    contributions from [Chee Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun), [Lakshan
    Perera](https://github.com/laktek), and 
    [Choon Kee Oh](https://github.com/soulofpeace).
  
  - [scheme2llvm](https://github.com/melvinzhang/scheme2llvm), from
    [Melvin Zhang](https://github.com/melvinzhang): a self-applicable
    LLVM front-end for a subset of Scheme.
    
  - [imap2json](https://github.com/kaihendry/imap2json), also by
    [Kai](https://github.com/kaihendry); this serves chosen IMAP
    directories through a web interface, so conversations can be
    referenced without in-MUA forwarding.

Also:

  - [Patrick Haller](https://github.com/patrickhaller) spoke on Ender's
    Game and game design, which I believe has resulted in the formation
    of a meetup group to discuss principles thereof. See [this
    thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hackerspacesg/l4tY_ww_FcU/MHRNnoR4OL0J)
    for more details.

  - [James](https://github.com/yarbelk) and [Chinmay Pendharkar](https://github.com/notthetup)
    discussed plans for developing systems to moderate door access to
    the Hackerspace. [Rahul](https://github.com/rahulg) and
    [Shan](https://github.com/shannietron) are also involved with this.
